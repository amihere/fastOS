## Fast OS

- Nix flakes - Manage Packages & Version Lock.  
- Nix Home Manager - Configure packages for user.  
- Neovim (mainly setup & options, with Mason & Packer stripped out and placed in Nix HM)
- Tmux (coming soon)
- Z SHell (git and z plugins setup with Nix + oh-my-zsh)
- i3 (minimal config with keybindings made vim-like)
